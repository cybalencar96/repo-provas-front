You are an in progress graduation student. You're in the fifth period and you're disgusted with one thing: the teachers don't release the old exams for you to study. That's because they reuse the same proofs, slightly adapted, so they don't have to work to produce new proofs.

This might even be good for them, but the students end up not having material to train and feel safe for the tests.

However, as a solution solver, you decide to handle this problem: you want to make a platform for people to share (anonymously) the old and on going exams for posteriority.
